## State Management

This project uses **Riverpod** for state management. Riverpod was chosen for several reasons:

- **Type Safety**: Provides compile-time safety and better IDE support
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in dependency injection capabilities
- **Code Organization**: Better code organization with providers
- **Testing**: Easier to test compared to other solutions
- **Performance**: Efficient rebuilds and better performance

### Provider Structure

The app uses a combination of Riverpod and Hive for state management and persistence:

- `eventBoxProvider`: A Provider that gives access to the Hive box storing events
  ```dart
  final eventBoxProvider = Provider<Box<Event>>((ref) {
    return Hive.box<Event>("events");
  });
  ```

- `eventListProvider`: A StateNotifierProvider that manages the list of events
  ```dart
  final eventListProvider = StateNotifierProvider<EventNotifier, List<Event>>((ref) {
    final box = ref.watch(eventBoxProvider);
    return EventNotifier(box);
  });
  ```

- `EventNotifier`: State notifier class that handles CRUD operations:
  - Add new events with UUID generation
  - Update existing events
  - Delete events
  - Automatically persists changes to Hive storage
